Tao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name. 
Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things. 
Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations. 
These have the same source, but different names. 
Call them both deep - Deep and again deep: the gateway to all mystery.

Recognize beauty and ugliness is born. 
Recognize good and evil is born. 
Is and Isn't produce each other. Hard depends on easy, Long is tested by short, 
High is determined by low, Sound is harmonized by voice, After is followed by before. 
Therefore the sage is devoted to non action, Moves without teaching, 
Creates ten thousand things without instruction, Lives but does not own, Acts but does not presume, 
Accomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, Accomplishment endures.

Don't glorify heroes, And people will not contend. 
Don't treasure rare objects, And no one will steal. 
Don't display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed. 
Therefore, the Sage rules By emptying hearts and filling bellies, By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; Leads people Away from knowing and wanting; 
Deters those who know too much From going too far: 
Practices non-action And the natural order is not disrupted.

Tao is empty- its use never exhausted. 
Bottomless - the origin of all things. 
It blunts sharp edges, Unties knots, Softens glare, Becomes one with the dusty world. 
Deeply subsistent - 
I don't know whose child it is. It is older than the Ancestor.

Heaven and Earth are not kind: The ten thousand things are straw dogs to them. 
The Sage is not kind: People are straw dogs to him. 
Yet Heaven and Earth And all the space between Are like a bellows: Empty but inexhaustible, Always producing more. 
Longwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.

The Valley Spirit never dies. It is called the Mysterious Female. 
The entrance top the Mysterious Female Is called the root of Heaven and Earth. 
Endless flow of inexhaustible energy.

Heaven is long, Earth enduring. 
Long and enduring Because they do not exist for themselves. 
Therefore the Sage Steps back, but is always in front, Stays outside, but is always within. 
No self-interest? 
Self is fulfilled?

Best to be like water, Which benefits the ten thousand things And does not contend. It pools where humans disdain to dwell, Close to the Tao. 
Live in a good place. Keep your mind deep. Treat others well. Stand by your word. 
Make fair rules. Do the right thing. Work when it's time. 
Only do not contend, And you will not go wrong.

Hold and fill it - No as good as stopping in time. 
Measure and pound it - It will not long survive. 
When gold and jade fill the hall, They cannot be guarded. 
Riches and pride Bequeath error. 
Withdrawing when work is done: Heaven's Tao.

Can you balance your life force And embrace the One Without separation? 
Can you control your breath Gently Like a baby? 
Can you clarify Your dark vision Without blemish? 
Can you love people And govern the country Without knowledge? 
Can you open and close The gate of heaven Without clinging to earth? 
Can you brighten The four directions Without action? 
Give birth and cultivate. Give birth and do not possess. Act without dependence. Excel but do not rule. This is called the dark Te.

Thirty spokes join one hub. The wheel's use comes from emptiness. 
Clay is fired to make a pot. The pot's use comes from emptiness. 
Windows and doors are cut to make a room. The room's use comes from emptiness. 
Therefore, Having leads to profit, Not having leads to use.

Five colors darken the eyes. Five tones darken the ears. Five tastes jade the palate. 
Hunting and racing madden the heart. Exotic goods ensnarl human lives. 
Therefore the Sage Takes care of the belly, not the eye, Chooses one, rejects the other.

Favour and disgrace are like fear. Honour and distress are like the self. 
What does this mean? Favour debases us. Afraid when we get it, Afraid when we lose it. 
The self embodies distress. No self, No distress. 
Respect the world as your self: The world can be your lodging. Love the world as your self: The world can be your trust.

Seeing but not seeing, we call it dim. Listening but not hearing, we call it faint. Groping but not touching, we call it subtle. 
These three cannot be fully grasped. Therefore they become one. 
Rising, it is not bright; setting it is not dark. It moves all things back to where there is nothing 
Meeting it there is no front, following it there is no back. 
Live in the ancient Tao, Master the existing present, Understand the source of all things. This is called the record of Tao.

The ancients who followed Tao: Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating. Deep beyond knowing. 
Because they cannot be known, They can only be described. Cautious, like crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like respecting one's neighbours. Polite, like a guest. 
Yielding, Like ice about to melt; Blank, like uncarved wood. Open, like a valley. Mixing freely, like muddy water. 
Calm the muddy water, It becomes clear. Move the inert, It comes to life.? 
Those who sustain Tao Do not wish to be full. Because they do not wish to be full They can fade away Without further effort.
